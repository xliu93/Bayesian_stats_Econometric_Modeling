## Bayesian Statistics and Econometric Modeling

Welcome :)

### Introduction

My study notes, simulations, backtesting of econometric models and algorithms will be posted here. Hopefully I will organize them on my personal website soon. 

### Topics
Topics covered (and will be covered):

- Bayesian Statistics
	- Bayesian approach to modelling, inference, point estimation, and forecasting, 
	- sufficient statistics
	- exponential families
	- conjugate priors 
	- posterior predictive density
- multivariate regression
	- Bayesian regression, 
	- variable selection techniques, 
	- multilevel/hierarchical regression models
	- and generalized linear models (GLMs)
- state estimation and parameter learning in Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
	- Kalman filter
	- Baum-Welch algorithm 
	- Bayesian networks and belief propagation
- Solution techniques 
	- Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, 
	- Gibbs Sampling,
	- EM algorithm,
